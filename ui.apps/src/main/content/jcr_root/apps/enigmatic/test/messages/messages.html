<p class="author-msg-box author-edit"><span>Edit</span> This is a box meant to tell the author there's something to be edited in the current component. You can achieve it with
	<em>author-msg-box</em> <strong>author-edit</strong> classes. These are independent to some extent and can be replaced.
</p>
<p class="author-msg-line author-error"><span>Error</span> This is a line meant to tell the author there's seriously something wrong or an operation failed.
	We achieved this by replacing the previous classes by
	<em>author-msg-line</em> <strong>author-error</strong> respectively. The first one changed the size, the second - colors and icon.
</p>
<p class="author-msg-narrow author-success"><span>Success</span> This is a narrow line meant to tell the authors their operation succeeded. We used
	<em>author-msg-narrow</em> <strong>author-success</strong> respectively. The first one minimizes the size as you can see hopefully.
</p>
<div class="author-msg-paragraphs author-warning">
	<p>This is a line meant to warn the author.</p>
	<p>We used <em>author-msg-paragraphs</em> <strong>author-warning</strong> respectively.</p>
	<p>The first one allows us to use paragraphs with more messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="author-preview-box">
	<p>The underlying background comes from <strong>author-preview-box</strong> class. You can use it to indicate the content is a preview of something.</p>
	<p>An example would be a popup content that cannot be easily shown within author's environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="author-preview-box">
	<span>Previewed Content's Title</span>
	Preview can display an icon when used with a span element just as in here.
</div>
<p class="author-msg-box author-notice"><span>Notice</span> This is a box meant to show a simple info. We used
	<em>author-msg-box</em> <strong>author-notice</strong>.
</p>
<p class="author-msg-box author-component"><span>Component</span> This is a box meant to show a component that has no visible content when published. We used
	<em>author-msg-box</em> <strong>author-component</strong>.
</p>
<p class="author-msg-box author-reference"><span>Reference</span> This is a box meant to show a reference indication. We used
	<em>author-msg-box</em> <strong>author-reference</strong>.
</p>
<p class="author-msg-box author-configuration"><span>Configuration</span> This is a box meant to show a configuration component without directly visible content when published. We used
	<em>author-msg-box</em> <strong>author-configuration</strong>.
